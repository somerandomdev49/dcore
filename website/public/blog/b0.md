
I decided to add a blog post system (suggested by one of our devs) to the website. Basically every website related to developing a product has a blog and from now on, so do we! It allows players to understand what is going on behind the scenes and helps the team to understand what everyone is going. For example I can write out certain issues in a blog to undestand them better and maybe help someone else solve them! That is very similar to [rubber-duck debugging](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

The blog will contain almost everything regarding the development of the game and thing about the game in general! Expect a blog post every week or so, when I have time to write one (others might write posts too sometimes!)
